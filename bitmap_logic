Search 0 - 0xFFFF

4 uint64_ts - each bit represents a 256 bit range

if that range is FULL with shapes it's a 1
otherwise it's a 0 and we can search the whole thing

set a shape to null - make that bit 0
set a shape to SHAPE - iterate over 256

"current_address_range" 256 bits FILL IT UP

each bit represents 10^12

if (search & 0xF) != 0xF
