compile flags in extconf are wrong
they need to link against librubygc
* How are hte flags determined
* Should we be statically linking test programs
  * What do the compile flags look like when Ruby is compiled as a shared library?


friday

* we're statically linking the GC in the extensions, but we want to dynamically link instead.
* modify mkmf changes, just want to link against dylib. mkmf assumes if ruby is static everything is static, need to split the flags.
* do we need to specify a full path to librubygc?
* we should get this working on linux and see what the requirements are there.
