Can make shapes shareable, need to take a ractor lock each time we mutate a
shape - transition



- Fix few failing tests on make test-all
- Fix few failing tests on shopify ci
- Implement debug_shape (wip so far)

Deal with out of shapes case:
- NO_CACHE_SHAPE_ID that is given to shapes when we're out of IDs

Get memory profile data:
- run "/usr/bin/time -l" on disourse, or railsbench or something for comparative
  memory_footprint

preallocate shapes
