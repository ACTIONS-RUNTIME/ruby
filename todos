# for cleaning up branch

- remove debug counters from debug_counter.h
- clean up poison patch and resubmit to merge
- obj_memsize_of check the diff - indentation issue
- merge master again
- change struct gen_ivtbl to use ifndef trick maybe ?? in internal/variable.h
- in w_ivar_each - make it an if RUBY_DEBUG not an rb_raise
- check out mjit_instruction ?? what's happening in there?
- put back test_objspace tests that were accidentally removed
- rename vm_call_attrset2 to vm_call_attrset_direct
- [pairing] clean up shapes ruby wrappers, maybe move into objspace

Nice to have:
- Could we pull shapes APIs into their own .h?

Note:
- ROBJECT_SET_SHAPE_ID doesn't work on 32 bit machines

# overall plan
- perf measurements again
- and speed measurements including memory profiling to figure out what's happening with vm_list
- write an update to upstream explaining progress, [if we're comfortable] asking if we can merge to avoid incurring additional tech debt, while we still work on perf more
- clean up diff
- improve perf
- improve memory etc etc
