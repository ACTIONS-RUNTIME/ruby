- test against actual codebase to get prelim numbers on # of shapes (65k limit
  currently)
     - Status: Chris S said he would relay info from Truffle
     - Optcarrot currently has 241 shapes (seems incredibly low??)
- move data out of objects and into the shapes (minimize lookups)
   - iv_index_table
- start thinking about other data structures to use
- think about documentation
- ensure writes are atomic so that it works with ractors - can do this by
  writing iv_index and shape_id to the same location
